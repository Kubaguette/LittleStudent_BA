This repo is part of Jakub Pietraszko's Bachelor Thesis with the title "Benefits of microlearning visualised in a mobile application".

## Important notes
Because this project is aimed to progress further beyond the bachelor thesis, security measures were taken. The firebaseConfig is censored and the keys for signing the apk are taken out of the project. If you try to launch this project without the firebaseConfig it will not work and that is intended. The code uploaded is only meant for the professors and examiners to look up and understand the working of the application.

**What needs to work is the apk file which you need to download to get the full current version working on any android device.**
Simply download the apk to any device and install it with any file manager. You may need to give permission access to android to install applications outside the Google Play Store.
